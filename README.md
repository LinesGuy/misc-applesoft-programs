# misc-applesoft-programs
A collection of programs written many years ago in Applesoft BASIC

All these programs can (hopefully) be run here: https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/

I made these just months after starting to learn programming for the first time so don't expect any remotely decent code.
Some lines of code can be thousands of characters long.
