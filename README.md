# misc-applesoft-programs
A collection of programs written many years ago in Applesoft BASIC

All these programs can (hopefully) be run here: https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/

Some of these programs are very heavily optimised (given the very limited instruction set) but I made this just months after learning programming for the first time so the code itself is a mess.
